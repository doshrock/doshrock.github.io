Allow me to introduce the **Roxboro Rockbottoms** - the West Island Champions and one of the most special soccer teams you'll ever meet.

What makes us the best? It's not just about winning:

- **Ball movement** - Our passing game is poetry in motion
- **Technique** - Every player brings skilled footwork
- **Diversity** - Our roster represents nations from all over the world
- **Game strategy** - We play smart, not just hard

We're more than teammates - we're family. And like any good family, we gather to celebrate the beautiful game together.

## Copa America Final Night

When the Copa America final came around - Argentina vs. Colombia - there was only one place to watch it: Doshrock!

Our team includes proud **Argentinians** and **Colombians**, so the stakes were personal. The atmosphere was electric with friendly rivalry, passionate cheering, and maybe a little nervous nail-biting.

Argentina took the trophy, but honestly? We celebrated for both teams. It was one of the greatest finals in recent memory - intense, dramatic, and showcasing the best of South American football.

At the final whistle, there were hugs all around. That's the Rockbottoms way.

## A Special Kitchen Visitor

While the adults were glued to the screen, we had a very special visitor in the kitchen - Bruno's baby! The little one was fascinated watching our chef work, eyes wide with curiosity at all the sizzling and stirring.

Who knows? Maybe we're witnessing the early inspiration of a future chef... or a future Rockbottom!

## More Than a Restaurant

Nights like these remind us why we do what we do. Doshrock isn't just a place to eat - it's a gathering place for friends, teammates, and families. Whether you're celebrating a championship, watching a big match, or just enjoying good food together, you're always welcome here.

To the Roxboro Rockbottoms: here's to more victories, more finals watched together, and more memories made!
