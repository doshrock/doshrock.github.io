One of the greatest joys of running a restaurant is witnessing the friendships that form around our tables. Today, I want to share a story about a special group of regulars who have made Doshrock part of their weekly tradition.

## A Friendship Forged in the Skies

See the gentleman in the blue denim jacket? That's my long-time soccer friend - a great striker with a British accent that I still can't fully understand after all these years! He and the rest of this group worked together in the aerospace industry, and through late nights, challenging projects, and shared dreams, they became life-long friends.

## The BYOW Adventurers

This wonderful group has a unique tradition: every week, they explore Montreal's BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine) restaurants together. Armed with their favorite bottles and an appetite for adventure, they've discovered hidden gems across the city.

What started as a simple idea to enjoy good food with good wine has become a cherished ritual - a way to stay connected, share stories, and create new memories together.

## Finding a Home at Doshrock

We're honored that Doshrock has become one of their regular stops. Watching them laugh, share plates of Korean food, and pour wine for each other reminds me why I opened this restaurant in the first place.

It's not just about the food - it's about bringing people together.

## To Friendship

To my striker friend with the mysterious accent, and to the entire group: thank you for making Doshrock part of your journey. Your friendship inspires us, and your weekly visits brighten our restaurant.

Here's to many more Wednesday evenings, many more bottles shared, and many more years of friendship.

Cheers, friends! 건배!
