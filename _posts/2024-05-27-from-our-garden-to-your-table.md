Every spring, we get our hands dirty in the best way possible - planting seeds in our greenhouse that will become part of your dining experience at Doshrock.

## Our Organic Garden

We grow **perilla leaves (깻잎)**, **lettuce**, **cucumber**, and **baby radish** in our greenhouse. What makes them special? They're 100% organic.

**No chemicals. Ever.**

We use only compost and earthworms, letting the preserved, living microbes in the soil do their natural work. The result is vegetables that taste like they should - fresh, vibrant, and full of life.

## A Gift from Our Garden

These vegetables aren't on our menu - you can't order them. Instead, **we share them for free** when we have them available, only during the summer months. It's our way of sharing something special with our guests.

## The Korean Art of Ssam (쌈)

Why do we grow these particular vegetables? They're perfect for **Ssam** - one of Korea's most beloved dining traditions.

### What is Ssam?

Ssam (쌈) comes from the Korean verb "싸다" meaning "to wrap." It's the art of wrapping rice, meat, and condiments in fresh leafy vegetables before eating. Simple concept, incredible experience.

### A Tradition with Deep Roots

Historical records show Koreans enjoying ssam as far back as the 14th century, when Chinese writers noted that "Korean people wrapped rice in fresh lettuce." During the Joseon dynasty, ssam was considered refined dining for the elite. By the 18th-19th centuries, it had become beloved by everyone.

### The Perfect Ssam

The classic combination:
- **Fresh lettuce or perilla leaf** as the wrap
- **A spoonful of rice**
- **Grilled meat** (like our bulgogi or samgyeopsal)
- **A dab of ssamjang** (the perfect blend of doenjang and gochujang)
- **A slice of garlic or pepper** for extra kick

Wrap it all together, eat it in one bite, and experience the harmony of flavors and textures that makes Korean cuisine so special.

## Summer at Doshrock

When summer arrives and our garden is producing, ask us about our fresh vegetables. If we have them, they're yours to enjoy - our gift to you, straight from our garden to your ssam.

This is what Korean home cooking is all about: fresh ingredients, shared with care, enjoyed together.
