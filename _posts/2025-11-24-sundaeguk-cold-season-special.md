## What is Sundaeguk?

Sundaeguk is a hearty Korean soup featuring **sundae** (Korean blood sausage) served in a rich, milky pork bone broth. This beloved dish has been warming Korean souls for generations, especially popular among workers and students seeking a filling, satisfying meal.

The soup comes with tender pork, various cuts of meat, and of course, slices of sundae - Korean blood sausage filled with glass noodles and seasonings. It's traditionally served with rice and customized at the table with:

- **Dadaegi** (다대기) - spicy seasoning paste
- **Saeujeot** (새우젓) - salted fermented shrimp
- **Kkakdugi** (깍두기) - cubed radish kimchi

## Why It's a Special Menu

We've chosen to offer Sundaeguk as a **seasonal special** rather than a regular menu item for a few reasons:

**It's a polarizing dish** - Sundaeguk has a distinctive taste that some people absolutely love while others may find unfamiliar. We want guests who order it to know what they're getting into!

**Labor of love** - Proper Sundaeguk requires serious preparation. Our bone broth alone takes **at least 12 hours of simmering** to achieve that rich, cloudy, deeply flavorful base. This isn't something we can rush.

**Priced accordingly** - Due to the intensive preparation, Sundaeguk is priced slightly higher than our regular menu items. We believe in doing it right or not at all.

## Availability
