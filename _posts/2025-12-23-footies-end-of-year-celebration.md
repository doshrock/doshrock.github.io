Some friendships are measured in years, some in shared experiences. With the Footies, it's both - 13 years and counting!

## A Soccer Family

When I joined this group 13 years ago, everyone looked so young - well, except maybe Tony Sr. Sr. who was already the wise elder of the group. Now, looking around the table, we've all aged a bit, but here's the beautiful thing: the joy in this group has only grown bigger.

## The British Accent Challenge

Let's be honest - most of the Footies are Brits. And after 13 years, I've developed a very sophisticated strategy for understanding their accents: I just nod and smile! But hey, this is a soccer group, not a conversation club. On the pitch, we speak the universal language of football.

They might be a step slower than their younger days, but the passion? The banter? The competitive spirit? All still there, stronger than ever.

## Our Loyal Friends

Many of the Footies have become regular patrons at Doshrock, and they've sent us countless friends and family over the years. This kind of word-of-mouth support means the world to us. When someone trusts you enough to recommend you to their loved ones, that's the highest compliment a restaurant can receive.

## Welcome and Welcome Back!

A special welcome to **Ron**, our newest Footie! May you have many years of great soccer and even better friendships with this group.

And a warm welcome back to Canada to our accounting organizer - home is where the heart is, and we're glad your heart brought you back!

## Thank You, Dave

Finally, a huge thank you to **Dave** for organizing the Footies for all these years. Keeping a group together, coordinating schedules, booking fields, and planning gatherings like this one - it takes dedication and love for the game. Dave, you've given us something special, and we appreciate you!

Here's to many more years of soccer, friendship, and end-of-year celebrations at Doshrock!

⚽ Cheers, Footies! 🎉
