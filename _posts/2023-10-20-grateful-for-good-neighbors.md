When we started preparing to open Doshrock in June 2023, we knew it would be a challenging journey. What we didn't expect was how much support we would receive from our neighbors and local business community.

## The Long Road to Opening

Starting a restaurant involves more than just cooking great food. The permit process and administrative requirements took longer than we anticipated. We had everything ready to go, but the paperwork seemed endless. What was supposed to be a quick process extended for weeks.

## A Helping Hand from Jimmy

That's when our neighbor Jimmy stepped in. Jimmy runs [Polydx Plastic](https://polydxplastic.com/), a high-quality plastic sheets business right here in our community. When he saw that we were waiting for our official signage, he kindly offered to create a temporary sign for us so we could open our doors.

Thanks to Jimmy's generosity, we were able to welcome our first customers on July 5th, 2023. His support meant everything to us during those stressful early days.

## Our Logo - Designed with Love from Korea

Our beautiful logo was designed by a talented designer in South Korea, who is a friend of my daughter. The design perfectly captures the essence of Doshrock - combining traditional Korean elements with a modern, welcoming feel.

## Our Official Sign by Epic Advertising

For our permanent signage, we worked with [Epic Advertising](https://www.epicadvertisinginc.ca/). The owner, Hasan, is incredibly professional and a pleasure to work with. He understood our vision and delivered a beautiful sign that truly represents Doshrock.

## More Than Business Partners

What makes this story special is that both Jimmy and Hasan have become more than just business connections—they're our friends and regular customers. They've supported us from day one, and we're proud to support their businesses too.

This experience taught us that success isn't just about what you do—it's about the community you build along the way. To Jimmy, Hasan, and all our neighbors who believed in us: thank you.

We look forward to serving you for many years to come!
