Some of our most memorable moments come from special requests by our regular customers. Today, I want to share a story about our friend Jin and his quest for authentic Korean home cooking.

## Meet Jin - The Multi-Sport Champion

Jin is one of those rare individuals who excels at everything athletic. A **multiple champion of the Montreal Amateur Tennis Asian Cup**, he holds certified instructor licenses and works as a registered lecturer at ski resorts. In winter, he teaches private ski lessons; in summer, he's on the tennis courts. He even plays soccer at the number 7 position!

I personally learned advanced swimming techniques from him - he's not just a talented athlete but also a gifted teacher with a natural ability to coach any sport or leisure activity.

You can find his private lessons at **[Mon Ski and Tennis](https://www.monskiandtennis.com/)**.

## The Special Request

After Jin had tried every item on our menu, he came to us with a unique request: "Can you make something that feels like home? The kind of meal every Korean family has on an ordinary day."

Our chef was delighted to create this special homestyle meal:

- **불고기숙주볶음** - Bulgogi with stir-fried mung bean sprouts
- **고등어구이** - Grilled mackerel, a Korean household staple
- **고추장아찌** - Pickled chili peppers
- **깻잎장아찌** - Pickled perilla leaves
- **삼찬** (three side dishes): 김치, 오이장아찌, 감자조림 - Kimchi, pickled cucumber, and braised potatoes

## A Taste of Home

This is the beauty of Korean home cooking - simple ingredients prepared with care, served together to create a balanced, comforting meal. It's what mothers make, what families gather around, and what Koreans abroad miss the most.

Thank you, Jin, for inspiring us to share this taste of home. And thank you for being such a wonderful regular!
