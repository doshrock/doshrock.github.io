We're excited to add another crowd favorite to our Anju menu: **Corn Cheese (콘치즈)**!

## A Korean Original

Despite its Western-sounding name and ingredients, corn cheese is actually a Korean creation! Many people assume this cheesy, sweet dish came from America or Europe, but it originated right here in Korea during the 1990s.

The dish emerged after canned sweet corn (particularly the Green Giant brand) became widely available in Korea. Korean chefs creatively combined it with mozzarella cheese and mayonnaise, creating a unique fusion that became an instant hit. Records of corn cheese recipes can be found in Korean archives dating back to before 2001!

## Why Koreans Love It as Anju

Corn cheese has become one of the most beloved drinking snacks in Korea for several reasons:

- **Quick and simple** - It's easy to prepare and serve hot
- **Universal appeal** - The sweet and savory combination appeals to everyone
- **Perfect with drinks** - The rich, cheesy flavor pairs wonderfully with beer and soju
- **Great value** - Satisfying and shareable at an affordable price

The sweet corn, creamy melted cheese, and savory mayonnaise create an irresistible combination that keeps you reaching for more - and reaching for another glass!

## The Secret is in the Technique

What makes corn cheese special is the cooking technique. The corn is sautéed in butter until slightly caramelized, mixed with mayonnaise for that signature creamy taste, then topped with mozzarella cheese and baked until bubbly and golden. The crispy, caramelized edges are the best part!

The mayonnaise is essential - without it, you lose that distinctive Korean corn cheese flavor that sets it apart from simple corn with cheese.

## Come Try It!

Our corn cheese is made fresh to order, served hot and bubbling straight from the oven. It's perfect for sharing with friends while enjoying your favorite drinks with our BYOB policy.

Add it to your Anju selection on your next visit - we promise you'll be hooked!
