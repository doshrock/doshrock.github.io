If you've visited Doshrock, you might have noticed a distinctive bottle on our wall - an Andong Soju bottle featuring the iconic Hahoe mask. It's not just decoration; it's a piece of Korean history.

## 700 Years of Distilling Tradition

**Andong Soju** (안동소주) traces its origins to the 13th century, when Mongol invasions inadvertently introduced Arab distillation techniques to Korea. The city of Andong, in the heart of the Korean peninsula, became a center for this craft, with noble families perfecting their own recipes over generations.

After being banned in 1962 due to grain rationing laws, traditional Andong Soju was revived in 1990 and designated as one of Korea's official folk liquors. Today, it holds status as an intangible cultural heritage - a living treasure of Korean craftsmanship.

## The Hahoe Mask: More Than a Label

The bottle we display features the **Hahoe tal** (하회탈), traditional masks from Andong used in folk performances for centuries. These masks are famous for their expressive faces - representing humor, satire, and the voices of common people.

In traditional performances, the masks allowed villagers to mock the ruling class through comedy and dance. They represent the Korean spirit of finding joy and laughter even in difficult times.

## Why It Hangs on Our Wall

Displaying this Andong Soju bottle is our way of honoring Korea's deep-rooted traditions, where food, drink, and art are inseparable parts of everyday life.

The Hahoe mask represents warmth, storytelling, and shared experiences - exactly what we want Doshrock to embody. It's a perfect symbol for a restaurant that values bringing people together.

As a wall decoration, this bottle becomes more than packaging. It's a conversation piece that invites guests to ask about Korean history, regional craftsmanship, and traditional rituals.

The bold facial expression and hand-painted look add a distinct Korean visual identity, instantly setting our atmosphere apart from ordinary dining spaces.

## Try Andong-Style Soju in Quebec

Want to experience premium Korean soju yourself? You can find **Ilpoom Jinro** (일품진로) - a premium soju in the Andong tradition - right here in Quebec at the [SAQ](https://www.saq.com/en/13142690).

"Ilpoom" (일품) means "first-class" or "premium," and this soju lives up to its name. At 25% alcohol content, it's smoother and more refined than standard soju, making it perfect for sipping alongside Korean dishes. The elegant frosted bottle with traditional calligraphy reflects the care put into this spirit.

Bring a bottle to Doshrock (we're BYOB!) and enjoy it the Korean way - with good food and good company.

## Korean Dining Philosophy

Hanging this bottle reflects our belief that Korean dining is not just about eating - it's about culture, laughter, and connection around the table.

In Korea, sharing food and drink has always been a communal experience. Soju is poured for others, never for yourself. Meals are shared from common dishes. Stories are told between bites.

When you dine at Doshrock, we hope you feel this spirit. The Hahoe mask watches over every meal, smiling with centuries of Korean tradition behind it.

건배! (Geonbae!) - Cheers!
