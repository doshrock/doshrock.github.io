We're excited to announce a special addition to our menu: the **Anju section**! To celebrate receiving our Bring Your Own Alcohol (BYOB) permit, we've created a selection of authentic Korean dishes perfect for enjoying with your favorite beverages.

## What is Anju?

In Korean culture, **Anju (안주)** refers to food that is specifically enjoyed with alcoholic drinks. Unlike Western bar snacks, Anju is an integral part of Korean drinking culture - it's considered impolite to drink without eating!

The word "Anju" comes from the Chinese characters 按酒, meaning "to press down alcohol." The tradition dates back centuries and reflects the Korean belief that food and drink should be enjoyed together in harmony. Whether you're having soju, makgeolli, or beer, there's always a perfect Anju to accompany it.

## Our New Anju Dishes

### Eomuktang (어묵탕) - Fish Cake Soup

Eomuktang is a beloved Korean comfort food, especially popular during cold weather. This warm, savory soup features Korean fish cakes (eomuk) simmered in a light anchovy and kelp broth. The broth is subtly sweet and deeply satisfying - perfect for sipping between drinks to warm your soul.

In Korea, you'll find Eomuktang at street food stalls, pojangmacha (tent bars), and family gatherings. It's the ultimate companion for soju on a chilly evening.

### Jeyuk Tofu Kimchi (제육두부김치) - Spicy Pork with Tofu and Kimchi

This dish is a trio of flavors and textures that Koreans absolutely love with their drinks. Tender slices of spicy stir-fried pork (jeyuk) are served alongside silky steamed tofu and tangy, fermented kimchi.

The combination is genius: the rich, spicy pork contrasts beautifully with the mild, cooling tofu, while the kimchi adds a punch of umami and crunch. It's one of the most popular Anju choices in Korean bars and restaurants.

## Bring Your Own Bottle!

With our new BYOB permit, you can now bring your favorite wine, beer, or soju to enjoy with these delicious dishes. There's no corkage fee - just great food and great company.

Come experience the authentic Korean drinking culture at Doshrock. Whether you're celebrating with friends or enjoying a quiet evening, our Anju menu is waiting for you!

건배! (Geonbae!) - Cheers!
